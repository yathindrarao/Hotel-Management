using GUI I made a Hotel Management where the number of items are been given by the user and the cost of the each item is
predefined at the backend. It takes a unique reference number for the each bill and the data is being identified by that reference 
number. And there is an inbuilt calculator which helps to calculate the extra change and that must be given to the customer.
By pressing the Total button the total of the bill is being calculated and by Reset the bill is being reseted to the intial postion.
It will provide us the time when the billing is done on the top of the bill.
